abstract: "While parties may slowly adapt their political agendas, crisis events may generate marked short-term reactions by political leaders. In this paper, we examine the responses of political elites in Peru to the sudden influx of immigrants from Venezuela.  Using computational text-analysis methods over a corpus of over half million of tweets from the Peruvian legislators' cohort elected in 2016, we investigate the short-term impact of the crisis on immigration salience and politicians' positions before, during, and after the first mass south-south migration. Our estimates reveal that attention to immigration increased drastically for all parties in response to the crisis, with both right and leftist legislators contributing to its saliency. Surprisingly, most of the communication was positive, with no increase in anti-immigration statements.  However, with time all legislators used a rhetoric more similar to the right regarding the immigration issue after the shock. Moreover, we find that political leaders used strategic framing, with right-wing legislators focusing on the Venezuelan political crisis.  Our findings have important implications for policies, as well as for understanding the particularities of South-South migration and how politicians can use these crises for domestic gains."

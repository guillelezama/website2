<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I am on the Job Market AY 2024-25!</strong></p>

Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Pittsburgh, specializing in Applied Microeconomics and Political Economy. I apply methods like Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and causal inference to study how economic and political shifts influence political rhetoric and behavior. My research includes examining politicians' responses to corruption and immigration shocks, their engagement on social media, the effects of penalties from OFAC on firms, and environmentally friendly consumption patterns in response to extreme weather events, highlighting my commitment to interdisciplinary, data-driven social science research.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

I was born and raised in Uruguay, where I completed my undergraduate studies and a Master’s in International Economics at the Universidad de la República (Udelar). My background includes an internship at Amazon and extensive experience in research, teaching, and advising both a politician and a college dean.

As you navigate through my website, you will find information about my research, publications, presentations, teaching, and other professional activities. You can also explore my coding portfolio and visit my <a href="https://github.com/guillelezama">GitHub</a> to see examples of my work.
{style="text-align: justify;"}. You can find my resume and contact information if you would like to get in touch with me.

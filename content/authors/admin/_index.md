I am a data scientist and applied economist (PhD, University of Pittsburgh) specializing in experimentation, causal inference, NLP, and ML-driven systems. My work combines rigorous statistical methods with production-oriented tools — including large-scale text classification with LLMs, automated experimentation pipelines, and interactive data applications. I also teach courses on exploratory data analysis and unstructured data methods.

title: Uruguayan Elections
summary: This project focuses on processing electoral data from Uruguay. It aims to provide a user-friendly way to access election results by precinct, leveraging a custom-built web application hosted on Heroku. Users can easily obtain results from their precinct in the most recent elections by entering their ID. Additionally, the application offers insights into the voting trends by computing and presenting the differences in election results by precinct between the last two elections.

## Features

- **Election Results by Precinct** Enter your ID to view the election results for your precinct in the latest elections.
- **Trend Analysis** I have also analyzed changes in election outcomes by precinct between the most recent two elections (2014 and 2019). The precincts highlighted are specifically from Las Piedras, indicating a focused analysis on this area.

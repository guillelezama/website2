summary: This project focuses on processing electoral data from Uruguay. It aims to provide a user-friendly way to access election results by precinct, leveraging a custom-built web application hosted on Heroku.

Additionally, the application offers insights into the voting trends by computing and presenting the differences in election results by precinct between the last two elections.

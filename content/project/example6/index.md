title: Uruguayan Elections
summary: This project focuses on processing electoral data from Uruguay. It aims to provide a user-friendly way to access election results by precinct, leveraging a custom-built web application hosted on Heroku. Users can easily obtain results from their precinct in the most recent elections by entering their ID. Additionally, the application offers insights into the voting trends by computing and presenting the differences in election results by precinct between the last two elections. In the app, you can enter your ID to view the election results for your precinct in the latest elections. I have also analyzed changes in election outcomes by precinct between the most recent two elections (2014 and 2019). In the picture, the precincts highlighted are from the city of Las Piedras (my hometown). To use the application and explore the election data, please click on the title to go to the GitHub repository. The source code for this project is available on GitHub.
